exercises on Hadoop-WordCount example

Ex1.
Requirement:
  Being able to output the pair whose key is started with '9' only
  
Ex2.
Reuqirement:
  Use MapReduce(), to eliminate duplicate keys in the given data.
  (this is similar to the method of making a list to a set, but do it in a mapreduce fashion)
 
Ex3:
Requirement:
  Reverse the default ordering of the result
Reflection:
  similarly the comparison can be applied to composite keys.
